# something like this

# (lp Token value at start and lp token value at end, eth value at the end of reward tokens accumlated)
# ingnore gas costs for now. swap costs, slippage, timeing, competence, routing, all of that jazz

# I think we would have to compare the growth of a dollar in the different destinations to growth of a dollar autopilot because our nav per share includes swap costs and rebalancing costs. If we just looked at the apr then it would make the autopool look worse than if someone were to actually deploy ETH for a return somewhere.
# Would a table like this work:
# 1 ETH in DestinationA between July 1 and Aug 31 would have turned into 1.005 ETH
# 1 ETH in DestinationB between July 1 and Aug 31 would have turned into 1.002 ETH
# ...
# 1 ETH in balETH between July 1 and Aug 31 would have turned into 1.008 ET
